For now it features:
- Responsive views (aka buttons don't go crazy depending on your screen size)
- 1 Player mode (an AI that just presses buttons randomly (better than nothing though))
- 2 Player mode
- Nice and simple UI
- Supports Android 7 and higher
- Personally tested on numerous devices (Xiaomi Note 13 Pro, Lenovo K3 Note, Lenovo Tab 4 8 (TB-8504F))

TODO:
- Ukrainian localization
- Have player choose between going X or O in 1 Player mode
- Light mode
- Custom app icon
- Much nicer design, at least the main menu
- Score system? ;-)

To actually build this app, just open the cloned folder in Android Studio, it should recognize it as a project.
