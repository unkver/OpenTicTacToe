# OpenTicTacToe (OpenTTT) v0.0.2
### Play your (probably) favorite FOSS game on your (probably) favorite android.
For now it features:
- Responsive views (aka buttons don't go crazy depending on your screen size)
- 2 Player mode
- Nice and simple UI
- Supports Android 7 and higher
- Personally tested on numerous devices (Xiaomi Note 13 Pro, Lenovo K3 Note, Lenovo Tab 4 8 (TB-8504F))
*TODO: 1 Player Mode, Light mode, Quit Procrastinating*
To actually build this app, just open the cloned folder in Android Studio, it should recognize it as a project.
